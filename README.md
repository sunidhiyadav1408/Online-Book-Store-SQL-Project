# ðŸ“š Online Bookstore SQL Project (MySQL)  

This project is a **SQL-based Online Bookstore Database System** built using **MySQL**.  
It demonstrates how relational databases are designed, populated, and queried to analyze and manage data.  

The project uses **dummy CSV data** for Books, Customers, and Orders. Data was imported into MySQL using the **MySQL Workbench Import Wizard**.  

The purpose of this project is to practice **database design, importing data, and writing SQL queries (basic and advanced)** to solve business-oriented problems.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  

- **Books Table** â€“ Stores book details (title, author, genre, year, price, stock).  
- **Customers Table** â€“ Stores customer details (name, email, phone, city, country).  
- **Orders Table** â€“ Stores orders (order date, book purchased, quantity, total amount).
