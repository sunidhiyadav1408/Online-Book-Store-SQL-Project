    "## üìå Project Overview  \n",
    "This project analyzes the **Divvy Bike Sharing dataset (2024)** with over **4.5 million ride records**.  \n",
    "Using **Excel Power Query & PivotTables**, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and trend analysis to uncover usage patterns.  \n",
    "The project concludes with an **interactive dashboard** built in Excel, showcasing monthly trends, peak hours, and rider behavior.  \n",
